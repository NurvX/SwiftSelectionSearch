# Privacy Policy for Swift Selection Search

**Last Updated: January 1, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how the Swift Selection Search browser extension ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and handles information. By using this extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

### Text Selections
- When you select text on web pages, the extension temporarily captures the selected text to enable search functionality.
- This data is not stored permanently; it is used only to construct search URLs and is discarded immediately after use.

### User Settings
- The extension stores your preferences, including:
  - Enabled/disabled state of the extension
  - List of configured search engines and their settings
  - Options for auto-copying text to clipboard
  - Popup and context menu preferences
- These settings are stored locally in your browser's storage (chrome.storage.sync) and may be synced across your devices if you have Chrome sync enabled.

### Technical Data
- The extension does not collect any personally identifiable information, browsing history, or analytics data.
- No cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies are used.

## How We Use Information

- **Text Selections**: Used solely to perform searches on your selected search engines when you click search icons or use context menus.
- **User Settings**: Used to customize the extension's behavior according to your preferences.
- We do not use any collected information for advertising, marketing, or any other purposes beyond providing the extension's core functionality.

## Data Storage

- All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API.
- Settings are stored in `chrome.storage.sync`, which means they may be synced across your Chrome installations if you have sync enabled.
- No data is transmitted to our servers or any external services except when you initiate a search.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

- We do not share, sell, or rent any personal information to third parties.
- The extension does not transmit data to us or any other entity.
- When you perform a search, the selected text is sent directly to the search engine you choose (e.g., Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) as part of the URL. This is subject to that search engine's own privacy policy.

## Third-Party Services

- The extension integrates with various search engines. When you use the extension to search:
  - Your search query is sent to the selected search engine.
  - The search engine's privacy policy applies to any data collection or processing they perform.
- We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party search engines.
- The extension fetches favicons from search engine domains to display icons, but this does not involve transmitting personal data.

## Your Rights and Choices

- **Disable the Extension**: You can disable or remove the extension at any time through your browser's extension manager.
- **Clear Data**: You can clear stored settings by resetting the extension or clearing browser data.
- **Control Settings**: Use the extension's options page to configure which features are enabled and which search engines to use.
- **Browser Controls**: Your browser provides additional controls over extension permissions and data storage.

## Children's Privacy

This extension is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and, if appropriate, providing additional notice through the extension or our repository.

## Contact Us

- Other relevant privacy regulations
